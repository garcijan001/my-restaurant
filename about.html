        <p>Growing up eating fast food was for tournament days, which were a lot of days.
        As much as I liked eating out my most favorite meals were my moms comforting homecooked meals.
         Savor and Stay is a cozy place where you want to eat out but meals will taste more like home.
         This place not only is a restaurnt but theres a separate and cozier section for those who want to study or work.
         The purpose to this is the cozy feeling of dimmed lights and light ambiance for customers to feel safe and warm.â€‹</p>
